# PS0: Hello SFML

## Contact
Name: Aniketh Rai	
Section: COMPIV
Time to Complete: 40Min


## Description
The PS0 project has to show that SFML (simple fast media library) works.
It also shows a Circle at top left of screen and also an image (Sprite.png).
This image can be move around using Keyboard Keys.
The Sprite is used in this program along with its features.

### Features
I Chose the WASD as moving around keys, As many are familiar than the Arrow Keys.
Also I Chose to do it on Linux environment rather than the Windows, As I found SFML more Flexible in Linux.
The Linux Environment I chose is Ubuntu 22.04.

### Issues
My Image cannot be blend to the default background of the window. There by it looks like a square within Image and its Annoying. In guess Some of my drivers are not updated.
Also Sometimes the Image Moves Way too fast.

### Extra Credit
I have added a Return to origin point for the Sprite Image i.e, By Pressing Backspace you can move the image back to its
Initial position.
Also I Have added a MouseEvent By which we can Move the Sprite image around by clicking on Window.



## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.

         ESSAY:
               The Academic misconduct is mandatory policy for the Academic students, but few students may not give the respect toward these policies. Therefore, it leads to Malpractise. In my opinion, the (f) examples is most likely to be applied to this class.
               The Comp-IV class has Tremendous assignments and Quiz. Students tend to fail if one cannot qualify in these assignmets and test. Therefore, The friends of such student try to assist them  with the assignments and Quiz answers. This leads to a penalty for the student as well as the friend. Sometimes there is a possible outcome of stress, where the student has done an extensive part-time and was not able to complete his or her assignment are given sympathy by others and provided with all the assignments.
